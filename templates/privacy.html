      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: {{ last_updated }}</p>
      <div class="notice">
        This policy explains what Lecture Processor stores and how that data is used. This document is an operational baseline for a student-run project and should be reviewed by qualified legal counsel before public/commercial launch.
      </div>

      <h2>1. Who This Applies To</h2>
      <p>This policy applies to your use of Lecture Processor, including the website, dashboard, study library, planner, and related features.</p>

      <h2>2. Service Operator</h2>
      <p>Lecture Processor is operated by the project owner/maintainer (the "operator"). The operator determines how data in this app is processed and is the contact point for privacy requests.</p>

      <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>Depending on how you use the service, we may collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Account and sign-in data (for example email address, user ID, sign-in provider) through Firebase Authentication.</li>
        <li>Uploaded files and generated learning content (such as PDFs, audio files, transcripts, notes, flashcards, and practice questions).</li>
        <li>Study organization and progress data (such as folders, study packs, card states, goals, and planner entries).</li>
        <li>Purchase and credit data (for example bundle purchased, amount, currency, and Stripe session ID).</li>
        <li>Operational and security logs (for example processing job logs, error details, rate-limit events, and high-level event telemetry).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. How We Use Data</h2>
      <p>We process personal data to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide core features (file processing, study tools, credits, and account access).</li>
        <li>Maintain service reliability, security, abuse prevention, and debugging.</li>
        <li>Operate payment workflows and purchase history records.</li>
        <li>Improve product quality using aggregated operational metrics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Legal Bases (EEA/UK-style Summary)</h2>
      <p>Where applicable, we process data under one or more of these bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contract/performance: to provide requested features and account functionality.</li>
        <li>Legitimate interests: to secure, monitor, and improve service reliability.</li>
        <li>Consent: where a specific feature requires permission (for example browser notifications).</li>
        <li>Legal obligations: to keep records where required by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Processors</h2>
      <p>Lecture Processor relies on service providers that process data on our behalf, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google Firebase (authentication and database services).</li>
        <li>Google Gemini API (AI processing of uploaded materials and prompts).</li>
        <li>Stripe (payment checkout and transaction processing).</li>
        <li>Sentry (error monitoring), when configured.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Uploads, Audio, and Transcript Handling</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Uploaded files are processed to generate study outputs.</li>
        <li>For packs with playback features enabled, a processed audio file may be stored so playback and notes-to-audio sync can work.</li>
        <li>Audio/transcript data can be removed by deleting the study pack or deleting the account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Payments</h2>
      <p>Card details are processed by Stripe and are not stored on Lecture Processor servers. We store purchase metadata required for crediting, support, accounting, and fraud prevention.</p>

      <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain data for as long as reasonably necessary to provide the service and meet legal obligations. Retention can vary by data type:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generated study packs and user study data are retained until removed by the user or by administrative cleanup.</li>
        <li>Temporary processing files are intended to be removed after processing completes.</li>
        <li>Stored study-pack audio files are removed when the corresponding pack or account is deleted (subject to technical failures).</li>
        <li>Purchase/accounting records may be retained longer where required for legal, tax, audit, or fraud-prevention obligations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Security</h2>
      <p>We use access controls, authentication checks, and server-side validation to reduce unauthorized access and abuse. No online system is fully risk-free, so absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

      <h2>11. International Processing</h2>
      <p>Your data may be processed in countries where our infrastructure providers operate. Those transfers are handled through provider contractual safeguards where applicable.</p>

      <h2>12. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export personal data, and to object to certain processing activities.</p>
      <p>You can request a self-service export or account/data deletion from the dashboard user menu when signed in.</p>

      <h2>13. Requests and Contact</h2>
      {% if legal_contact_email %}
      <p>For privacy requests (access, deletion, export, correction), contact: <a href="mailto:{{ legal_contact_email }}">{{ legal_contact_email }}</a>.</p>
      {% else %}
      <p>For privacy requests (access, deletion, export, correction), contact the project owner through your support channel and include your account email and request type.</p>
      {% endif %}

      <h2>14. Local Storage and Browser Data</h2>
      <p>The app may use browser storage (for example <code>localStorage</code>) to keep UI preferences and cached study state. Clearing browser data may remove locally cached values.</p>

      <h2>15. Children</h2>
      <p>This service is intended for students and adult learners and is not designed for children under the age required by applicable law in your region.</p>

      <h2>16. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this page when product behavior or legal requirements change. Material changes should be reflected by an updated date above.</p>
